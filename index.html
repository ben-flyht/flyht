      <h1>We prototype and scale bespoke websites.</h1>
      <p>Complex doesn’t have to mean complicated (despite what others may tell you). With over 20 years of experience in digital consultancy, development and team building, we know what it takes to navigate the digital journey successfully.</p>
      <p>We specialise in a web application framework called <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> &mdash; the same one behind the success of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/">Airbnb</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.shopify.co.uk/">Shopify</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> (to name a few). We host and support these applications on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, a platform-as-a-service offering from <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a>. This combination allows us to deliver highly secure and scalable sites while remaining nimble and budget–friendly &mdash; giving even your most hardened financial and legal colleagues something to smile about.</p>
      <p>Our clients currently include <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.selectcarleasing.co.uk">Select Car Leasing</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://51degrees.com">51 Degrees</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.savethechildren.org.uk">Save The Children</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://motorsportshowroom.com/">Motorsport Showroom</a>.</p>
      <p>We’re based in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Reading/@51.4514358,-1.0660873,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48742078d93d3db7:0x2ae19f7fcefa7994!8m2!3d51.4542645!4d-0.9781303">Reading, Berkshire, UK</a>.

      <h3>What's so good about Ruby on Rails?</h3>
      <p>Great question; glad you asked. Yes, some people write code with PHP, Python or Perl but there are some distinguishing factors about <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> (the language) and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> (the framework) that in our experience make them the tools of choice when building innovation projects. They allow us to write concise, human-centric and dare we say it, beautiful code. We're able to bring your ideas to life elegantly and quickly and that makes us (and hopefully you) very happy. If you wanted to dig a little deeper, maybe have a read about the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine">Rails doctrine</a>.</p>

      <h3>Can we host elsewhere?</h3>
      <p>Yes you can. Truth be told, hosting is the least exciting part of what we do. All the code we write is contractually owned by you. If you want to host it somewhere else, you are absolutely free to. We care about speed and efficiency and that's why we're pretty selective with who we use ourselves. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> is built on top of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> so provides exceptional scale and performance and is designed to minimise development cost. If it puts your mind at rest, one of our clients regularly sees 10k requests per minute averaging a page response time under 60ms which (if you care about this stuff) is very good.</p>

      <h3>What makes you different from anyone else?</h3>
      <p>You'll find developers who are cheaper. You'll find agencies that are bigger. You'll find consultants with more computer science degrees. We are shaped distinctly around bringing your ideas to life with experience drive but without the weight or wait associated with some of the alternatives.</p>
      <p>If you’d like a partner that’s honest, straightforward and committed – we could be a great fit. We’ll let you know when we can help and when we can’t, guiding you towards your best instincts and away from ill-conceived or poorly-tested plans, so that we can make your digital project as brilliant as it deserves to be.</p>
